              Effective date: April 16, 2026. This policy describes how Football Era
              (“the app”), published by Howeth Studio, treats information on your
              device when you play.

                Career progress, slot saves, preferences, and other gameplay state
                needed to run Football Era are stored locally on your device. Howeth
                Studio does not operate a sign-in or cloud save service for core
                gameplay as part of this policy unless a future version explicitly
                tells you otherwise in the app and updates this page.

              <h2>When information is processed off-device</h2>
              <p>
                Like other iPhone apps, Football Era relies on Apple platform services
                for distribution, updates, and device-level features (for example
                system keyboards or accessibility). Those flows are governed by
                Apple’s policies. If you purchase or restore in-app content, Apple
                handles payment and receipt validation.

              <p>
                The app is not built around ad tracking or behavioral advertising. If
                Apple provides optional crash or diagnostic sharing on your device,
                whether any data is sent depends on your iOS privacy settings and
                choices in the Privacy and Security section of Settings.
