            Effective date: March 11, 2026. This policy describes how CareNote CNA
            handles information when users create notes in the app and choose to
            use optional AI-assisted features.

            <p>
              The app stores resident profiles, shift reports, transcripts, and app
              settings locally on the device so users can create, review, edit, and
              export reports. Local reliability counters may also be stored to track
              failed saves, abandoned drafts, and AI retry behavior.

            <h2>When data leaves the device</h2>
            <p>
              If a user chooses AI-assisted note features, the app may send
              transcript text and reviewed structured fields to CareNote servers so
              note suggestions can be generated. The iPhone app does not store the
              OpenAI API key.

              Speech recognition may use Apple platform services. Depending on the
              feature being used, CareNote servers may also send eligible requests to
              OpenAI for structured note assistance or summary generation.

              saves, abandoned drafts, queued AI retries, retry attempts, retry
              successes, and retry failures. These counters are intended to stay
              aggregate and should not contain resident narrative text.
