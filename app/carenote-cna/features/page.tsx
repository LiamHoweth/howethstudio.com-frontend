            CareNote CNA is designed to help caregivers move through documentation
            with less friction. Structured charting stays at the center, and smart
            note assistance helps speed up the parts that usually take the longest.

            <p>
              CareNote CNA is built for repeated daily use: selecting a resident
              quickly, capturing what happened during the shift, reviewing the
              note, and saving without losing time at the end of the day.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is especially useful for caregivers who want a cleaner process
              than scattered notes, memory-based charting, or rushed end-of-shift
              summaries.
